Hello.
Today, I will study
the driven pendulum.
In the end,
we will have this workspace -scroll down
which delivers
the equation of motion
of the driven pendulum.

It is a differential equation,
according to Newton's second law. -press run

But in the beginning,
is a clear the workspace -reload browser
and Newton's first law.

In some inertial frame of reference,
an object continues to move in space
at a constant velocity.

It takes time to do that,
so our function
which we call path-of-free-particle -2
depends on time. -3
It returns a vector of two dimensions, -4
because we make the choice
of our free little path to live in two dimensions.

The Kinetic Energy
is  half the mass times velocity squared.
If we set the mass to two kilogram,
the formular becomes simpler. -5

We know that the velocity of our free particle
is 5 meters per second in the x direction,
and 4 meters per second in the y direction.
An object continues to move in space
at a constant velocity after all.

But notice that our Kinetic Energy
is much more versatile.
It could eat any velocity we feed it 
the velocity even could depend on time.
And it certaily will depend on time
in the case of the pendulum.

The Lagrangian -8
is just the kinetic Energy. -9
which we feed the vector
of the velocity components.

In general, a Lagrangian
not only depends on the velocity 
but also on time and position,
both of which are not yet using.

The Lagrangian equations
are Differential equations -11
which eat the path -12
and deliver a function of time,
which we set to 10 seconds here. -13

Lets print the equations: -14

--press run

The equations are the zero vector
because we fed the solution to the
equation of motion.

Now comes the magic trick:
I create a vector of two arbitray functions
call tehm qx and qy -15
and replace the known path with it. -16
and run again.

--press run

I Make the equations prettier
and replace 10 by some time 't -17
and introducing a mass 'm
into the Kinetic Energy -18
I can even throw away the path-of-a-free-particle
like a ladder after climbing a wall. -19

--ress run

Here we are,
the equations of motion
for the free particle:
the second derivtive is zero.

Now introduce gravity
bay means of the potential energy
which depends on the hight -20
and is m times g times hight.
Where g is 9.8 meters per second per second,
the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth. -21

The Lagrangian is
Kinetic Energy minus Potentil Energy -22
the Lagrangian now depends on th hight. -23

Pressing run delivers the equations
for the particle in the homogenous
gravitational field.

--press run

The moving particle will be turned
into the pendulum by introducing
constraints on the coordinates x and y.

I do this by making a coordinate
transformation to some angle. -24
The angle is kind of buried
in the chamber of some blocks,
notice the same depth as the
y coodinate in the Lagrangian.

The horizontal position x
is just 'l times sine of the angle. -25
'l beig the length of the pendulum
The hight of the bob is
'h minus 'l time cosine phi -26
'h being the hight of the pivot

The new Lagrangian is obtained by
prepending the Lagragian of 

with the transformation -27
and we need some function phi -28
and replace the old Lagrangian
and functions. -29

pressing run

--press run

delivers the equation for the function phi.

making the hight of the pivot time dependent:
Introduce th function hight-of-pivot
whic depends on time -30
and is some arbitrary function -31
replace 'h by this funtion -32
