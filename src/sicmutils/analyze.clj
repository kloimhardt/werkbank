(defprotocol ICanonicalize
  "ICanonicalize captures the methods exposed by a scmutils analyzer backend.
  Analyzer backends find canonical forms of inputs over limited vocabularies of
  operations. For example, a polynomial backend will expose operations like
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation by positive
  integers (but not division). An expression containing only these operations
  and symbols can then be converted to and from a polynomial canonical form,
  which in this example would have the effect of grouping like terms; a
  rational function backend would include the division operation and be capable
  of cancellation. Canonicalizing an expression with respect to an analyzer is
  therefore effected by a round-trip to and from the canonical form."

  "Make-analyzer takes an analyzer backend (which implements ICanonicalize) and
  provides the apparatus necessary to prepare expressions for analysis by
  replacing subexpressions formed from operations unknown to the analyzer with
  generated symbols, and backsubstituting after analysis is complete. (For
  example, in the case of polynomial canonical form, we would replace a
  subexpression like (sin x) with a gensym, before entry, since the sine
  operation is not available to the polynomial canonicalizer, and restore it
  afterwards."
