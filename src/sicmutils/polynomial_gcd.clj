;; several observations. many of the gcds we find when attempting the troublesome
;; GCD are the case where we have two monomials. This can be done trivially
;; without lowering arity.
;;
;; secondly, we observe that lowering arity often produces constant polynomials.
;; can we get away with just dropping these to scalars, instead of constant
;; polynomials of lower degree?
;;
;; then we could special-case the question of GCD of a polynomial with a
;; basic number. That's just the gcd of the number and the polynomial's
;; integer coefficients.
;;
;; open question: why was dividing out the greatest monomial factor such
;; a lose? it's much cheaper to do that than to find a gcd by going down
;; the arity chain.
